# MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACKS

1. Gather information about the connected clients.
2. Understanding ARP
3. Understanding Man In Middle Attack

## Gather information about the client**

- Specify the manufacture company of the client devece.
- Discovering thier MAC IP addresses.
- Discovering their operating system.

***Netdiscover:** Is a network address discovering tool that was developed mainly for those wireless networks, IT send ARP REQUEST and SNIFFS for replaces.*

`netdiscover -i wlan0 -r 192.168._._`

Check router default getway address, `route -n`
Check wifi card name, `iwconfig`

***Zenmap:** Is the network discovery tool that can be used to get detailed information (client, network, target) on the internet. Zenmap is the of clal nmap security scanner GUI. It is a multi-platfrom such as Linux, Windows and Mac os.*

**Scap Type:**

- *Ping Scan:* Showing us the connected clients.
- *Quick Scan:* Showing us more details such as MAC address and the ports.
- *Quick Scan Plus:* Showing us the operating system and the ports and the name service of the port and the version.

## Address Resulation Protocol (ARP)

ARP is a network leayer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address.

*ARP is used to link out IP address to our ethernet address.*

**ARP security issue:**

1. Clients can accept a response even if they did not send a request.
2. Each ARP request or response is trusted.

**ARP SPOONG:** ARP Spooing is a type of attack in which a maliious actor sends falsied arp messages over a tocal area network.

- Sending ARP response to the client tells him I AM THE ROUTER.
- Sending ARP Request to the router tells him I AM THE CLIETNS.
- This will help us to poison the client ARP TABLE and put inside of router MAC address our MAC address.
