# Protect Your WiFi AP Against Previous Method

### Protect Wi-Fi access point.

- Change the encryption from **WEP** to **WPA/WPA2**
- Disable **WPA** feature from the router.
- Set a comple wi-fi password.
- Change the default password to the router.
- Hide the **ESSID (The AP Name)**.
- Enable **IP** & **Flood Detection**.

### Detect ARP Poisoning Attack using XARP

**XARP** is a security application that uses advance techniques to detect ARP based attacks.

First we have to download **XARP** from the official website. This tool is available windows and linux.

`http://www.xarp.net/#download`

Download, install and run then if anyone use ARP Poisoning then we will got notification. Its only notification arp table can not protect possoning.


### Detect ARP Poisoning using Wireshark

**Wireshark** is a free and open source packet anayzer. It is used for network troubleshooting analysis, software and communications protocol development.

- Sniff the trafic into the network and try to detect anything suspicious by checking if there is someone is trying to scan our network from active devices.
- By checking if someone is trying to poision the arp table by telling us there is duplicate IP address.

Run wireshark and select your interface. Then go to `Edit > Preferences > Protocols - ARP/PARP`

Now run **zenmap** and scan (ping scan) your network. Then we have to little wait for the result.

Then open **wireshark** and filter *arp* then we will see someone is scaning our network and we will see the IP.

Now open a terminal for tesing and type this command.

`arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.1`

Now open another terminal and use this command.

`arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.5`

Then comeback wireshark and go to `Analyz > Expert Information` and we will see the information if someone try to arp poisoning.


## Prevent ARP Table From Poisoning

**Static Mac:** means MAC address can not be modified.
**Dynamic MAC:** means MAC address can be modified.

We will modify the mac address from dynamic to static in our ARP Table so the attacker will not be able to poison the arp table.

Open your windows command prompt and type this command,

`arp -a`

We will see the dynamic mac address list. We will change dynamic to static for prevent arp poisoning.

Then close our windows command prompt and again run command prompt as administrator. Use this command,

`netsh -c "interface ipv4"`

and enter. Then type-

`show neighbors`

We will see the all ip table. Found the interface number and use this command.

`set neighbors <interface number> <which mac you want to static> <which mac you want to static>`

Ex: `set neighbors 4 192.168.0.1 fe:85::8a:99:73:cc:fe:30:1c:00`

Press enter and CTRL+C. Then type `arp -a`

Then we will our target ip is static now.
